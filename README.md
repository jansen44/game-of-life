This is just a simple implementation of conway's game of life written in Rust+WGPU.

This is NOT a good implementation: it's resource heavy, the code is not at all organized and it's not good overall. The
reason for this is that this project became my little playground to test stuff. Feel free to read, run and update with it
in mind. Hope you like it <3.

# Controls:

- LMB -> add cell (only work on "pause");
- RMB -> remove cell (only work on "pause");
- R -> clear all cells;
- S -> start game;
- P -> pause;
