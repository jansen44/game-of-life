This is just a simple implementation of conway's game of life written in Rust+WGPU. This is actually my first "official" 
test-project using wgpu, so I'm very excited with the results!

It's really simple and there's a LOT of room for improvements (I mean, I was basically experimenting everything :P). Hope you like it <3

# Controls:
- LMB -> add cell (only work on "pause");
- RMB -> remove cell (only work on "pause");
- R -> clear all cells;
- S -> start game;
- P -> pause;
